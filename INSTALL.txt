NuoDB PHP PDO Driver install instructions for:

  32-bit Windows
  64-bit Linux

The NuoDB PHP PDO Driver is a shared library that is dynamically loaded by the PHP executable.  This shared library conforms to the PHP extension API and must be copied to your PHP extension directory. If you don't know the location of your extension directory, then you can use the following command to find the location:
 
  php -i | grep extension_dir

The NuoDB PHP PDO Driver shared library names are:

  pdo_nuodb.so on Linux.
  php_pdo_nuodb.dll on Windows.   


There are two versions of the NuoDB PHP PDO Driver shared library for Windows.  One that build using Microsoft Visual C++ 9 (MSVC9) compiler and another that was build using the Microsoft Visual C++ 10 (MSVC10) compiler.  The MSVC9 one is located in:

  C:\Program Files\NuoDB\drivers\php_pdo\vc9

The MSVC10 one is located in:

  C:\Program Files\NuoDB\drivers\php_pdo\vc10

You should use the version that matches the MSVC compiler version of your PHP executable.  To find out MSVC compiler version that was used to build your PHP executable, use the following command:

  php -i | grep Compiler

After you have copied the NuoDB PHP PDO driver to the extension directory, you need to modify your PHP configuration to automatically load the NuoDB PHP PDO driver when PHP runs. You can do this by adding the following line to your php.ini.  On Linux:

  extension=pdo_nuodb.so
 
On Windows:

  extension=php_pdo_nuodb.dll



Checking the PDO driver
 
After you have modified your PHP configuration, you can check if the NuoDB PHP PDO driver is loading correctly with the following command:
 
php -i | grep PDO
 
Which should show 'nuodb' in the list of PDO drivers and should also show "PDO Driver for NuoDB => enabled".
 

Using the PDO driver
 
If you have run the NuoDB quick start (run-quickstart), then you can use the example.php script to display information from the example "hockey" database.  Example execution output:
 
~/> php -c example.php
